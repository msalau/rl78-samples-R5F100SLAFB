These are simple applications showing usage of different parts and
capabilities of Renesas RL78 MCUs.

For more information about RL78 family visit Renesas web site:

These samples were tested on QB-R5F100SL-TB CPU board
populated with R5F100SLAFB MCU, but must run on other RL78 parts
without or with little changes.

The samples can be built using the rl78-elf-gcc toolchain.
The easiest option is to use a ready-to-use docket image with the toolchain:
https://hub.docker.com/r/msalau/rl78-elf-gcc

E.g.:
  docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/src" msalau/rl78-elf-gcc:4.9.2.202002 make

A pre-built toolchain can also be obtained from https://llvm-gcc-renesas.com/
